# Recession Analysis on Automotive Sales

Project Overview
You have been hired by XYZ Automotives as a data scientist. Your first task is to analyze the historical data and give the company directors insights on how the sales were affected during times of recession. You will provide a number of charts/plots to visualize the data and make it easy for the directors to understand your analysis. 

About the dataset
In this assignment you will be presented with varies question for analysing data to understand the historical trends in automobile sales during recession periods.

recession period 1 - year 1980 

recession period 2 - year 1981 to 1982

recession period 3 - year 1991

recession period 4 - year 2000 to 2001

recession period 5 - year end 2007 to mid 2009

recession period 6 - year 2020 -Feb to April (Covid-19 Impact)

The data used in this lab has been artifically created for the purpose of this assignment only. No real data has been used.

Data Description
The dataset includes the following variables:
1.	Date: The date of the observation.
2.	Recession: A binary variable indicating recession perion; 1 means it was recession, 0 means it was normal.
3.	Automobile_Sales: The number of vehicles sold during the period.
4.	GDP: The per capita GDP value in USD.
5.	Unemployment_Rate: The monthly unemployment rate.
6.	Consumer_Confidence: A synthetic index representing consumer confidence, which can impact consumer spending and automobile purchases.
7.	Seasonality_Weight: The weight representing the seasonality effect on automobile sales during the period.
8.	Price: The average vehicle price during the period.
9.	Advertising_Expenditure: The advertising expenditure of the company.
10.	Vehicle_Type: The type of vehicles sold; Supperminicar, Smallfamiliycar, Mediumfamilycar, Executivecar, Sports.
11.	Competition: The measure of competition in the market, such as the number of competitors or market share of major manufacturers.
12.	Month: Month of the observation extracted from Date.
13.	Year: Year of the observation extracted from Date.
By examining various factors mentioned above from the dataset, you aim to gain insights into how recessions impact automobile sales for your company.

Objective:
The objective of this part of the Final Assignment is to analyze the historical trends in automobile sales during recession periods. The goal is to provide insights into how the sales of XYZAutomotives, a company specializing in automotive sales, were affected during times of recession.

In this lab you will create visualizations using Matplotlib, Seaborn, Pandas.
Tasks to be performed
TASK 1.1: Develop a Line chart using the functionality of pandas to show how automobile sales fluctuate from year to year.
TASK 1.2: Plot different lines for categories of vehicle type and analyse the trend to answer the question “Is there a noticeable difference in sales trends between different vehicle types during recession periods?”
TASK 1.3: Use the functionality of Seaborn Library to create a visualization to compare the sales trend per vehicle type for a recession period with a non-recession period.
TASK 1.4: Use sub plotting to compare the variations in GDP during recession and non-recession period by developing line plots for each period.
TASK 1.5: Develop a Bubble plot for displaying the impact of seasonality on Automobile Sales.
TASK 1.6: Use the functionality of Matplotlib to develop a scatter plot to identify the correlation between average vehicle price relate to the sales volume during recessions.
TASK 1.7: Create a pie chart to display the portion of advertising expenditure of XYZAutomotives during recession and non-recession periods.
TASK 1.8: Develop a pie chart to display the total Advertisement expenditure for each vehicle type during recession period.
TASK 1.9: Develop a lineplot to analyse the effect of the unemployment rate on vehicle type and sales during the Recession Period.
