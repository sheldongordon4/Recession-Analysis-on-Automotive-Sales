# Recession Analysis on Automotive Sales

## Project Overview
You have been hired by XYZ Automotives as a data scientist. Your first task is to analyze the historical data and give the company directors insights on how the sales were affected during times of recession. You will provide a number of charts/plots to visualize the data and make it easy for the directors to understand your analysis.
The objective of this part of the Final Assignment is to analyze the historical trends in automobile sales during recession periods. The goal is to provide insights into how the sales of XYZAutomotives, a company specializing in automotive sales, were affected during times of recession.

### Data Sources
The dataset show historical sales data for automotives, hihglighting periods of recession. The data used in this lab has been artifically created for the purpose of this assignment only. No real data has been used.
- Recession period 1 - year 1980
- Recession period 2 - year 1981 to 1982
- Recession period 3 - year 1991
- Recession period 4 - year 2000 to 2001
- Recession period 5 - year end 2007 to mid 2009
- Recession period 6 - year 2020 -Feb to April (Covid-19 Impact)

### Tools
- JupyterLab Notebook

### Exploratory Data Analysis
1. Line chart showing sales fluctuations from year to year.
2. Line chart showing sales trends of different vehicle categories.
3. Use the functionality of Seaborn Library to create a visualization to compare the sales trend per vehicle type for a recession period with a non-recession period.
4. Use sub plotting to compare the variations in GDP during recession and non-recession period by developing line plots for each period.
5. Develop a Bubble plot for displaying the impact of seasonality on Automobile Sales.
6. Use the functionality of Matplotlib to develop a scatter plot to identify the correlation between average vehicle price relate to the sales volume during recessions.
7. Create a pie chart to display the portion of advertising expenditure of XYZAutomotives during recession and non-recession periods.
8. Develop a pie chart to display the total Advertisement expenditure for each vehicle type during recession period.
9. Develop a lineplot to analyse the effect of the unemployment rate on vehicle type and sales during the Recession Period.

### Results/Findings
- Inference: From this plot, we can understand that during recession period, the sales for 'Sports type vehicles' declined because of the high cost of the vehicle. while sales of the superminicar and smallfamilycar increased.
- From this plot, we can understand that there is a drastic decline in the overall sales of the automobiles during recession. However, the most affected type of vehicle is executivecar and sports
- From this plot, it is evident that during recession, the GDP of the country was in a low range, might have afected the overall sales of the company
- From this plot, it is evident that seasonality has not affected on the overall sales. However, there is a drastic raise in sales in the month of April
- Inference It seems ABCAutomotives has been spending much more on the advertisements during non-recession periods as compared to during recession times. Fair enough!
- During recession the advertisements were mostly focued on low price range vehicle. A wise decision!
- Inference During recession, buying pattern changed, the sales of low range vehicle like superminicar,smallfamilycar and Mediumminicar
